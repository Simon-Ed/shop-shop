# README

This is a readme explaining/documenting our website shopshop.

## Reasons

We have added alt tags on all images in accordance with slide 66 from **lecture_w34-35_intro_html_part1.pdf** this helps visualiy impared people or other people with screen readers to understand the content

we decided to start with a single home page that includes images and lists describing the main items on the store. this serves to give the customers/users information about the wares avaliable. the map also serves the purpose of displaying where the item was gathered.

We have added lang=en in the root html element this aids speech synthesis tools to know which language is used. In accordance from **lecture_w34-35_intro_html_part1.pdf**.
